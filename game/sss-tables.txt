7 modes, Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian

There are 7 modes in music:

Ionian - major scale
Dorian - minor-related
Phrygian - minor-related
Lydian - haunting major
Mixolydian - blues-like
Aeolian - natural minor
Locrian - most rare

Ionian – Major (no altered notes)
Dorian – minor +raised 6th, lowered 7th
Phrygian – minor + lowered 2nd, lowered 6th, lowered 7th
Lydian – Major + raised 4th
Mixolydian – Major +lowered 7th
Aeolian – minor + lowered 6th, lowered 7th

pseudocode for loading modes

-- mode 1, key C
for i = 1,7 do 
  note[i] = table[i]
end
modeShift = 0

-- mode 2, key C
for i = 1,7 do
  note[i] = table[i+1]
end
modeShift = -2

-- mode 3, key C
for i = 1,7 do
  note[i] = table[i+2]
end
modeShift = -4

-- mode 4, key C
for i = 1,7 do
  note[i] = table[i+3]
end
modeShift = -5

-- mode 5, key C
for i = 1,7 do
  note[i] = table[i+4]
end
modeShift = -7

-- mode 6, key C
for i = 1,7 do
  note[i] = table[i+5]
end
modeShift = -9

- mode 7, key C
for i = 1,7 do
  note[i] = table[i+6]
end
modeShift = -11

once we have the base set of 7 notes, we assign them
transpose = 0
-- release old source data (mapped 33 keys)
for i = 1,33 do
  keyAudio[i]:release()
end
-- load base set
for i = 1,7 do
  keyAudio[i] = love.audio.newSource( inst .. note[i]+modeShift+transpose .. ogg  )
end
-- load others based on offset
for i = 8,14 do
  keyAudio[i] = love.audio.newSource( inst .. note[i-7]+modeShift+transpose+12 .. ogg  )
  keyAudio[i+7] = love.audio.newSource( inst .. note[i-7]+modeShift+transpose+24 .. ogg  )
  keyAudio[i+14] = love.audio.newSource( inst .. note[i-7]+modeShift+transpose+36 .. ogg  )
end
-- load extended set
for i = 29,33 do
  keyAudio[i] = love.audio.newSource( inst .. note[i-28]+modeShift+transpose+48 .. ogg  )
end

-- permanent assignment
z = keyAudio[1]
x = keyAudio[2]
c = keyAudio[3]
